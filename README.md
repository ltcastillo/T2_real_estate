# What’s the question will we answer / topic

Based on real estate data, how have home prices in the bay area changed over the years and how can we predict changes to prices in the future?

 Create heatmap of the bay areas that reflect trends of the average cost of a house in the bay area down to it’s counties, cities, and zip codes, and size of home.
  

# Reason

We want to know how a person should save against a plan to purchase a home in the future (upcoming year, five years, ten years) depending on the zip code, city, and or county.
